# mac_code

This repository is a personal collection of small projects, utilities, demos, and experiments used for day-to-day tasks, data exploration, and prototyping. It contains many folders and scripts grouped by purpose rather than as a single packaged application.

**Overview**

- **Purpose:** A grab-bag of scripts, sample apps, dashboards, and supporting assets for personal use and experimentation.
- **Structure:** Top-level folders contain focused projects (web demos, data analysis, small utilities, and notebooks).

**Notable Folders (top-level)**

- **`blunders/`**: Data files, JSON/YAML conversion scripts, small demos and notebooks.
- **`dashboard/`**: Heatmap and dashboard example code, JavaScript visualizations and assets.
- **`home/`**: Personal website pages and assets (HTML/CSS, site content and templates).
- **`maps_api/`**: Maps and directions API examples, generated map pages, and helper scripts.
- **`edit_mp3/`**: Utilities for editing MP3 metadata and audio files.
- **`financial_analysis/`**: Dash app and scripts for financial data analysis.
- **`MineSpotify/`** and **`MineYT/`**: Small scripts interacting with Spotify and YouTube (playlist/enrichment tools and downloads).
- **`process_dashcam/`** and **`misc/`**: Various one-off utilities for file processing and automation.
- **`mahabharat/`**, **`periscope-home/`**, **`periscope_product/`**: Small web/demo projects with HTML/CSS/JS and deployment configs.

**Examples of scripts at repo root**

- `combine_pdfs.py`: Merge multiple PDFs into one.
- `move_images.py`: Utilities for organizing image files.

**Usage**

- Explore the tree and open the folder you're interested in: `ls` or `tree -L 2` from the repo root.
- Most folders contain their own README, example HTML pages, or small runner scripts—open those to see usage notes.
- Python scripts can be run directly with the system Python: `python3 path/to/script.py`.

**Contributing / Notes**

- This repository is intended for personal use and experimentation. Files and folders are intentionally informal and may contain throwaway scripts, demos, and notes.
- If you want any part reorganized, documented, or extracted into a separate project, open an issue or request and I'll help restructure it.
